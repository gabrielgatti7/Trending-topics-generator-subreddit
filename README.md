# Trending-topics-generator-subreddit
Trending topics of a subreddit

The idea of the project is very simple:

- Create an application that generates a trending topic for a subreddit chosen
- The program must receive as input:
  - A subreddit, for example: https://www.reddit.com/r/skincancer/
  - A start and end date
  - A number N of words to perform the ranking
- Your program must return as output:
  - The N most commented words of the period (from largest to smallest) saved in JSON format
  - An image with a word cloud for the most frequent words in the period (does not need to be the N most frequent)
